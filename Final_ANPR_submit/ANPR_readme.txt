Automatic Number Plate Recognition System

Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR Engine. It can be used on existing closed-circuit television, road-rule enforcement cameras, or cameras specifically designed for the task. Using Selenium web driver, number plate recognized is parsed to the government website vahan.nic.in along with the solved captcha and the vehicle details can be accessed for further Inference and analysis. The crawled information is converted to structured and unstructured data and stored in Firebase and MySQL for data analysis and live dashboard. Through the dashboard the notification triggers can be set if a vehicle defaults any of the rules , an SMS will be sent to the mobile phone of the authority. Tested on 1500 Indian Number Plates gave us a success rate of 64% which is better than the current existing systems. As well as, successfully retrieve vehicle information from secure government website with a success rate of 75%.
